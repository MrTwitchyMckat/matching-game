# Submission Notes

This info will be read by the dev team. Let us know what you thought!

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

- Add hover interactions.
- Make cards red and make then shake if you get them wrong.
- Add focus states and make the game ADA accesible. 
- Make the win screen gif randomized using the Giphphy API.
- Switch the app over to the composition API vs the options API.
- Split out the win screen into it's own component.  

## What part of your submission are you most proud of?

I spent a majority of my time working on the logic and functional code of the game. After my intial pass
I did a second pass and optimized the code in App.vue by removing a handful of redundent item (see the optimze code commit).
I also enjoyed writing the logic for the game a ton since I haven't had to do anything like this since college. It was
a fun little excercise.

## Is there anything else you'd like us to know?

### Technology used
- Vue.js - Options API method. 
- SCSS
- Integrated with the parcel base 

### Assumptions
Below are some assumptions I made when working on this.
- I made the cards green when they are correct. 
- There weren't any font sizes, so  I made some assumptions there. 
- I just set text to wrap when it needs to since there wasn't any mobile comps/breakpoints. 
- I made the end screen based on the colors and fonts of the exising UI.
